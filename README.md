## _Stable Marriage Cordination - Multi Arm Bandit_

## Installation

Run python code.

```sh
python SMC_MAB.py
```

## About
An algorithm that is designed to adapt to a stable configuration of channel while selecting them among multi user state.
Given the following constraints - 
- The characteristics of each channel are unknown and are different for each user
- User doesnâ€™t know about presence of other users in network
- No direct communication protocol among the users, that limits the information exchange.
